Since the videos we used for swapping were too big to be included in git, we have uploaded them at the below drive link. The output video file is also uploaded here.

>Download the source and destination video in the workspace folder.
>Run the bash file with command to generate video> bash 8_merged_to_mp4.sh
Please contact mka7840@nyu.edu if this model is not running correctly, uploading to git such huge file was a problem therefore we may have missed out on uploading something.
